=============
Version 0.1.6
=============

This release adds a dialog to gnome-dvb-control to manage recordings.
In addition, a bug in the channels scanner has been fixed. The results
should be reproduceable in each scan now. In addition, you can now
record multiple channels on the same transport stream at the same time.
EPG information is now stored for each device group separately. Therefore,
you have to delete the old database at ~/.cache/gnome-dvb-daemon.
